# Which inks should we use to print a design onto a t-shirt?

## You're given
* a design, specifying how much of each color is required
* an inventory of inks, each of which has a color and a cost per unit volume

## Your goal
Select an ink from the inventory for each of the colors in the design.

Solutions will be evaluated on:

* color accuracy
* total cost of inks (the lower the better)

## Files
Your solution should be runnable on the command-line as: `which_inks`.

### teeprint
`teeprint` is a test harness program that will evaluate your solution.

It can be run in three ways:

* `teeprint verify` double-checks the program is running correctly on your machine: do this first
* `teeprint practice` evaluates your solution with a simple scenario, and outputs detailed scoring information
* `teeprint evaluate` evaluates your solution with the full set of randomised scenarios

### inks.json
`inks.json` describes the available inks. Each ink is an array consisting of its RGB value and its cost per unit volume, keyed on a unique id. E.g.:
```
{
  "AB8172": ["85A059", 7.2],
  "CC0188": ["131F9F", 5.5],
  "JK1195": ["FFFFFF", 3.9],
...
```

## Input and Output

Information about the colors in the design will be supplied on STDIN; your solution should be output to STDOUT.

### Input format
Your solution will be invoked with input on STDIN representing a design.

There is a line for each color in the design, consisting of two tab-separated values:
```
RGB	volume
```

`RGB` consists of a hex triplet, as in HTML and SVG; `volume` is a floating-point number representing how much of this color is required. E.g.:

```
90A14F	1.4
1916A2	0.4
FFFFFF	2
```

This example represents a design with three colors.  In order to print, the design requires 1.4 units of `90A14F`, 0.4 units of `1916A2`, and 2 units of `FFFFFF`.

### Output format
Your solution should produce output on STDOUT.

Each line of output specifies the ink that should be used to print the color given in the corresponding line of input.

The output lines are strings which uniquely identify an ink by its key in `inks.json`.

Suppose your program received the input in the above example, and outputs this:

```
AB8172
CC0188
JK1195
```

This means:

* use ink `AB8172` for color `90A14F`
* use ink `CC0188` for color `1916A2`
* use ink `JK1195` for color `FFFFFF`

## Scoring
For each design, `teeprint` checks two things:

1. the disparity between the colors requested in the design, and the inks used in your solution
1. the cost of the inks used in your solution

The color disparity is calculated as the [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) in RGB color space. The maximum allowable total disparity for each design is **330**.

To verify there is a solution which has color disparity less than or equal to this limit, `teeprint` creates its own _reference solution_.

* if your solution has color disparity greater than **330**, you score **-100** points for this design
* otherwise, your score is how much cheaper than the _reference solution_ your selected inks are

For example, the following is an example evaluation of three separate invocations with three different design inputs:

```
| Color Disparity | Cost of reference solution | Cost of your inks | Score |
+-----------------+----------------------------+-------------------+-------+
| 200             | 150                        | 100               | 50    |
| 610             | 72                         | 61                | -100  |
| 110             | 43                         | 50                | 0     |
```
